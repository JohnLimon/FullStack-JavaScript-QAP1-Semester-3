2.a. Write a few sentences or paragraph describing each object and how it would be used.

hThe 3 common core objects I chose are:

http - The http module in Node.js allows you to create an HTTP server or make HTTP requests. 
        It provides functionality to handle HTTP methods, status codes, request, and response headers. 
        You can use it to build web servers or interact with APIs.

filesystem - The fs module provides functions to interact with the file system. 
        It allows you to read from and write to files, create directories, and perform various file-related operations.

url -   The url module provides methods for URL parsing and formatting. 
        It allows you to work with URLs, extract various components like protocol, host, pathname, query parameters, etc.
