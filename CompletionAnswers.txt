1. It took me 1hr per day to complete this QAP including rewatching lectures and youtube videos.

2. The online resources I used are YouTube videos and video lectures.

3. I asked and collaborate with my classmate and my wife Jelliebeth, we study together when kids are settled.

4. No, didn't asked my instructor.

5. For my own perspective, I think I'm confident that I can solve similar but different problem requiring 
   some of the same techniques in the future. If I would rate the difficulty of each questions, it's about average.
